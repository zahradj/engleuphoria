# Production Readiness Checklist

## ✅ Phase 1: Mock Data Cleanup
- [x] Removed hardcoded data from Student Dashboard
- [x] Removed hardcoded data from Teacher Dashboard  
- [x] All components now use real Supabase queries
- [x] Sample curriculum content preserved in database

## ✅ Phase 2: Email Notification System
- [x] Teacher notification on lesson booking (`notify-teacher-booking` edge function)
- [x] Admin notification on student registration (`notify-admin-new-student` edge function)
- [x] Email notifications integrated with lesson booking flow
- [x] Email notifications integrated with student signup flow
- [x] RESEND_API_KEY configured

## ✅ Phase 3: Database Optimization for Scale
- [x] Created indexes on `users` table (role, email, created_at)
- [x] Created indexes on `lessons` table (student_id, teacher_id, scheduled_at, status, created_at)
- [x] Created indexes on `notifications` table (user_id + created_at, is_read)
- [x] Created indexes on `homework` table (student_id, teacher_id, status, due_date)
- [x] Database triggers for notifications created
- [x] Admin dashboard stats view created

## ✅ Phase 4: Edge Functions
- [x] `notify-teacher-booking` - Email teacher when lesson is booked
- [x] `notify-admin-new-student` - Email admins when student registers
- [x] Database triggers configured to call edge functions
- [x] Edge functions deployed and registered in config.toml

## ✅ Phase 5: Admin Dashboard Enhancements
- [x] `RecentRegistrationsCard` - Shows last 10 student registrations
- [x] Real-time updates for new student registrations
- [x] `AdminActivityFeed` updated with real data from admin_notifications
- [x] `AdminNotificationCenter` - Header dropdown with notifications
- [x] Admin can mark notifications as read/unread
- [x] Integrated into `AdminHeader` component

## ✅ Phase 6: Performance Monitoring
- [x] Created `useOptimizedQuery` hook with caching strategy
- [x] Created `useRealtimeQuery` hook for live data
- [x] Performance monitoring utilities (`performanceMonitoring.ts`)
- [x] Debounce and throttle helpers for user inputs
- [x] Render time tracking utilities
- [x] Virtual scrolling helpers for large lists

## 🔄 Phase 7: Production Verification

### Database
- [x] All indexes created and verified
- [x] RLS policies enabled on all tables with PII
- [x] Database triggers active
- [ ] Run `SELECT * FROM admin_dashboard_stats` to verify stats view
- [ ] Test with 100+ mock students/teachers (load testing)

### Email Notifications
- [x] Teacher booking notifications configured
- [x] Admin registration notifications configured  
- [ ] Test email delivery with real RESEND account
- [ ] Verify `.ics` calendar attachments work
- [ ] Test with multiple admin recipients

### Edge Functions
- [x] All edge functions deployed
- [x] JWT verification configured appropriately
- [ ] Monitor edge function logs for errors
- [ ] Test error handling and retries

### Frontend Performance
- [x] React Query caching implemented
- [x] Performance monitoring utilities created
- [x] Add lazy loading for heavy components (classroom, curriculum)
- [x] Implement virtual scrolling for student/teacher lists
- [x] Production utilities integrated into main.tsx
- [ ] Test dashboard load time (<2 seconds)

### Security
- [x] All admin notifications require authentication
- [x] Email edge functions verify user roles
- [ ] Review all RLS policies for correctness
- [ ] Test unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Verify sensitive data is not exposed

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up Supabase query logging
- [ ] Configure edge function error alerts
- [ ] Monitor failed email deliveries
- [ ] Track slow queries (>500ms)
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

## 📊 Scale Testing Requirements

Before going live with 1,000+ students and 300+ teachers:

1. **Load Testing:**
   - [ ] Create 1000+ test student accounts
   - [ ] Create 300+ test teacher accounts
   - [ ] Simulate 100+ concurrent lesson bookings
   - [ ] Test real-time notification delivery at scale

2. **Database Performance:**
   - [ ] Verify all queries complete in <200ms
   - [ ] Check index usage with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   - [ ] Monitor connection pool usage
   - [ ] Test under peak load (500+ concurrent users)

3. **Edge Functions:**
   - [ ] Test edge function concurrency limits
   - [ ] Verify email queue doesn't back up
   - [ ] Test retry logic for failed emails
   - [ ] Monitor edge function cold starts

## 🚀 Go-Live Checklist

Final steps before production launch:

- [ ] Backup database
- [ ] Configure production RESEND domain (not resend.dev)
- [ ] Update email templates with production branding
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Configure alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Document runbook for common issues
- [ ] Train support team on admin dashboard
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Schedule launch during low-traffic period
- [ ] Monitor first 24 hours closely

## 📝 Post-Launch Monitoring (First Week)
