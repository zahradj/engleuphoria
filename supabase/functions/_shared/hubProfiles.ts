THREE PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORKS — analyze the topic + source + hub, then pick exactly ONE:

A) "Discovery" (Inductive). BEST FOR: tricky grammar that's easier discovered in context than
   pre-taught (irregular pasts, conditionals, tense contrast). Path:
   Reading → Comprehension → Grammar (puzzle the rule out) → Vocabulary → Speaking → Writing.

B) "TaskBased" (TBL). BEST FOR: adult/professional learners (Success hub) and any topic that
   maps to a real-world performance (write an email, run a meeting, negotiate, present). Path:
   Speaking (impossible task — try & fail) → Vocabulary (toolbox) → Grammar (strategy) →
   Reading (model text) → Comprehension → Writing (succeed at the task).

C) "Immersion" (Classic). BEST FOR: young learners (Playground hub) and pure beginners. Path:
   Vocabulary (visual) → Reading (story) → Comprehension → Speaking (guided) → Grammar → Writing.

Choose the framework that best fits the LEARNER (hub), the TOPIC, and the SOURCE MATERIAL —
not a default. Provide a 1-sentence "framework_rationale" naming the deciding factor.`;
