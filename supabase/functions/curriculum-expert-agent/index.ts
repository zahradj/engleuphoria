Requirements:
- Generate exactly ${unitCount} units
- Each unit must have exactly ${lessonsPerUnit} lessons (ideally 3 per unit for the "Slowly-Slowly" cycle)
- Each lesson needs: title, 3 objectives, grammarFocus, vocabularyTheme

🎯 THE "SLOWLY-SLOWLY" 3-LESSON CYCLE (apply to every unit):
If a unit has 3 lessons, enforce this cycle exactly:
  Lesson 1 — "Discovery" (cycleType: "discovery"):
    - FOCUS RATIO: 80% Phonics/Noun accuracy, 20% basic recognition activities
    - Focus: 1 phoneme (short sound) + exactly 5 nouns
    - Skills: Listening & Reading
    - phonicsFocus: the IPA symbol (e.g. "/æ/")
    - vocabularyList: array of 5 noun objects [{word, definition}]
    - grammarPattern: simple recognition pattern (e.g. "It is a ___")
    - skillsFocus: ["listening", "reading"]
  Lesson 2 — "The Ladder" (cycleType: "ladder"):
    - FOCUS RATIO: 80% Sentence building/Grammar, 20% vocabulary reinforcement
    - Focus: Verbs + Adjectives, build Sentence Ladders
    - Skills: Writing & Grammar
    - vocabularyList: verbs + adjectives (max 5 words)
    - grammarPattern: sentence ladder pattern (e.g. "It is a dog" → "It is a big dog")
    - skillsFocus: ["writing", "grammar"]
  Lesson 3 — "The Bridge" (cycleType: "bridge"):
    - FOCUS RATIO: 80% Student production/Speaking, 20% teacher guidance
    - Focus: Questions + Real-Life Use. The teacher should speak LESS and the student should speak MORE.
    - Skills: Speaking & Fluency
    - grammarPattern: question pattern (e.g. "What is it?", "Do you have a ___?")
    - skillsFocus: ["speaking", "fluency"]
    - Include a "realWorldMission" in the lesson content
    - MANDATORY: Include a "masteryCheck" field with the exact target question the student must independently produce (e.g. "What is it?" or "Do you have a cat?"). If the student cannot produce this question independently, flag for a Review Lesson before advancing to the next unit.

🔄 REVIEW LESSON MODE:
If the request includes "reviewMode: true", generate a condensed 30-minute Review Lesson that:
  - Revisits the unit's phoneme with 3 quick recognition activities
  - Reviews all 5 core nouns from Lesson 1
  - Practices the sentence ladder from Lesson 2
  - Re-tests the target question from Lesson 3's masteryCheck
  - cycleType: "review"
  - Mark as isReview: true in the output

🧠 COGNITIVE LOAD RULES:
- NEVER introduce more than 1 new phoneme per lesson
- NEVER introduce more than 5 new words per lesson
- Every lesson must scaffold from Recognition → Production

🔁 INTERLEAVED REVIEW RULE:
Every Lesson 1 (Discovery) of a NEW unit (unit number > 1) MUST include 2 vocabulary words from the PREVIOUS unit in its warm-up activities to ensure long-term retention.
Include a "reviewWords" field in the lesson JSON with 2 words from the prior unit.

📚 BALANCED SKILL OUTPUT:
Every generated lesson MUST include these 4 task fields:
- "listeningTask": a decoding or sound-matching task
- "speakingTask": a "Record & Compare" or oral production task
- "readingTask": a CVC word blending or sight-word task
- "writingTask": a tracing, typing, or fill-in-the-blank task

🔗 BRIDGE RETRIEVAL:
Every Lesson 1 of a NEW unit (unit number > 1) MUST begin with a 5-minute "Bridge Retrieval" pop quiz — 5 quick questions from the previous unit to activate spaced repetition before introducing new content.
Include a "bridgeRetrieval" field with 5 question objects: [{question, expectedAnswer}].

OUTPUT: Return ONLY a JSON array of ${unitCount} unit objects. Each unit has a "lessons" array.
Each lesson object MUST include: title, objectives, grammarFocus, vocabularyTheme, cycleType, phonicsFocus (if discovery), vocabularyList, grammarPattern, skillsFocus, listeningTask, speakingTask, readingTask, writingTask.
For Lesson 1 of units after Unit 1, also include: reviewWords, bridgeRetrieval.

Return ONLY the JSON array, no extra text.`;
